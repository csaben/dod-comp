# Weapon Target Assignment

This project was created during the NSWCDD Dahlgren hackathon by Team UMW: Clark Saben, Shane Alexander, and Christian Jakob. Our solution is a basic system for selecting incoming missiles based on their time to die. In addition, we prepared and trained a sequence-to-sequence model for translating incoming state information to an execution order.

## Project Description

The goal of the project was to develop a system for assigning targets to weapons in real-time. We approached this problem by selecting incoming missiles based on their time to die. The basic idea is that we can prioritize missiles that pose the most immediate threat to our assets.

In addition, we developed a sequence-to-sequence model for translating incoming state information to an execution order. This allows us to quickly and efficiently respond to incoming threats by automating the decision-making process.

# Interfacing with the code

NSWCDD provided their JCORE simulator for us to use for simulations and testing and is up to the organizers to share. As such our code is standalone.
Sample data will be generated to allow for standalone use of code when the team is able to put it together.

## Acknowledgments

We would like to thank the organizers of the NSWCDD Dahlgren hackathon for providing us with the opportunity to participate in this event. We would also like to thank our fellow competitors for their hard work and dedication, and for pushing us to do our best.
