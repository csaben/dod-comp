#we could have to protocols:
    # 1. if HVU then use that as the heap
    # 2. if not HVU then use the ..

# or custom; regenerate the heap every time we start a round or shoot at something 

# have the first heap be a simple HUV's that are savable then make the heap
# have the second heap after the first heap is exhausted be a shoot based on priority given via a
# savable calculation
